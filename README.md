# Learning Management System (LMS) with Spring Boot Microservices

## Overview
This project implements a Learning Management System (LMS) using Spring Boot microservices architecture. The system allows users to manage courses, lessons, quizzes, assignments, and user enrollments. Each microservice focuses on specific functionalities to ensure modularity and scalability.

## Features
User Service: Manages user authentication, registration, and profile management.
Course Service: Handles CRUD operations for courses, enrollment, and course-specific actions.
Lesson Service: Manages lessons within courses.
Enrollment Service: Handles student enrollment in courses and completion tracking.
Quiz Service: Manages quizzes and questions.
Assignment Service: Handles assignments, submissions, and grading.

## Technologies Used
Spring Boot: Microservices framework for Java
Spring Data JPA: Database operations and ORM mapping
Spring Security: User authentication and authorization
Spring Web: RESTful API development
Spring Cloud: Microservices management and communication
Database: [Specify the database used - e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL]

## Getting Started
Clone Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/lms-spring-boot.git
cd lms-spring-boot/
Build and Run Microservices
```

Navigate to each microservice folder (user-service, course-service, etc.)
Build and run using Maven or Gradle

```
mvn spring-boot:run
Configuration
```

Update the application properties for database configurations, ports, etc.
Ensure proper communication between microservices via config files.

## Testing

Utilize tools like Postman for API testing.
Implement unit tests and integration tests for each microservice.

## Deployment

Deploy microservices on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, Heroku) or containers (Docker, Kubernetes).

## API Endpoints
Document and list the available API endpoints for each microservice. Include details like request methods, endpoints, request/response bodies, and authentication requirements.

## User Service API
POST /api/register: Register a new user
POST /api/login: Authenticate user and generate JWT token
GET /api/users/{userId}: Get user details
...
## Course Service API
GET /api/courses: Get all courses
POST /api/courses: Create a new course
GET /api/courses/{courseId}: Get course details
...
